    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
        This app is designed to assist verified retail partners in placing order requests based on our public distribution stock list.
    </p>

    <h2>1. No Personal Information Collected</h2>
    <p>
        We do not collect, store, or share any personal user information through this app. All registration and onboarding processes are handled externally by our team.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Permissions Used</h2>
    <p>
        The app uses only the permissions necessary to function:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Internet Access</strong> – to display available products and pricing updates.</li>
        <li><strong>Notification Access</strong> – to notify users about new products, price changes, and stock updates.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        No personal data is accessed or transmitted through these permissions.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Crash Reporting</h2>
    <p>
        We use Firebase Crashlytics to identify and fix app crashes or bugs. Crash reports may include non-personal technical data such as device model, OS version, and error logs. This information is used solely to improve app stability and is not linked to personal identity or behavior.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Public Content Only</h2>
    <p>
        All product information displayed in the app — such as product names, salt compositions, and prices — is public and not tied to individual user data.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Contact</h2>
    <p>
        For questions about this privacy policy, please contact your assigned admin or reach out via our official WhatsApp channel.
