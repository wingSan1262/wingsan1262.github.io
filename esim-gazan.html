  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    This app is designed to help users in Gaza securely redeem donated eSIM data packages. We value your privacy and only collect minimal data required for functionality and fairness.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Personal Information</h2>
  <p>
    We collect only your <strong>name</strong> and <strong>email</strong> when you redeem a gift. This information is stored securely in Firebase Firestore and used solely to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Prevent abuse (limit redemption to once every 4 hours)</li>
    <li>Show your redeemed gift history</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do not share or sell your personal information.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Location Usage</h2>
  <p>
    The app checks your location to ensure that gift redemptions are made only from Gaza. Your exact location is not stored or shared.
  </p>

  <h2>3. QR Scanning</h2>
  <p>
    When you scan a QR code, the app reads the embedded eSIM activation string for installation guidance. This data is not uploaded or tracked.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Firebase Services</h2>
  <p>
    We use Firebase Firestore to store gift and user information, and Firebase Crashlytics to improve stability. Crash reports may include technical info (device model, OS version) but never personal identity.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Internet Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    Internet access is used only to load and submit data to Firebase and fetch redemption info.
  </p>

  <h2>6. No Ads or Analytics</h2>
  <p>
    This app does not serve ads or track behavior with analytics tools.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
  <p>
    If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact the app maintainer or sponsoring organization.
